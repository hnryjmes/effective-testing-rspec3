## Effective Testing with RSpec 3
###### by Myron Marston and Ian Dees

#### Notes

Introduction

* 'effective' - tests that are more valuable than the time spent to write them

* Behavior-Driven Development

Chapter 1 - Getting Started With RSpec

* How to install RSpec and write your first spec / How to organize your specifications using describe and it / How to verify desired outcomes with expect / How to interpret test failures / How to keep your specs free of repeated setup code

* Effectiveness. Do the benefits of writing the test outweigh the costs?

* First spec: groups, examples, expectations

* "A test validates that a bit of code is working properly."

* "A spec describes the desired behavior of a bit of code."

* "An example shows how a particular API is intended to be used."

* Arrange, Act, Assert

* hooks: common setup code
